## bio
---

hi, i'm ryan. as i use this particular github account for side projects and messing around with stuff, my intro here is somewhat less formal. (if all lowercase didn't already convey that) 


i graduated from uc berkeley with a double major in eecs and engineering physics back in 2019, studying some random things here and there but mostly stuff related to devices and semiconductor physics. i love that stuff. i love physics in general. but in my last semester at cal i took intro to embedded systems and made a hard shift in academic/career trajectory because i liked embedded systems just as much (if not more). so i applied to grad schools with split interest and somehow managed to join [prof houman homayoun's research group](https://www.ece.ucdavis.edu/~hhomayou/) and am now working in the area of embedded systems and security. i've had to play a lot of catch-up with this field, since i lacked exposure to a lot of the related areas and subjects while i was in undergrad (i was studying an almost entirely different area after all), but as hard as it has been, it's been pretty incredible getting to learn all this new stuff. i'm currently working on dynamic analysis for bare-metal firmware.


in general i really like embedded system design and development, tinkering and hacking around with hardware and software alike, and have a habit of building new tools for myself whenever i can't seem to find the right one. or feel like reinventing the wheel. i also love teaching. i spent ~2 years on the eecs16a course staff at uc berkeley and loved my experience. i hope one day i'll be able to focus on teaching more, but for now i still have a lot to do, and that seems like a long way off. i'll enjoy my ta appointments wherever i can get them.


as far as hobbies go, i love reading, especially classic fiction; longboarding, though i haven't gotten the hang of sliding yet; climbing, mostly indoors; and some miscellaneous other stuff you should ask me about sometime. i'm a part of the aim graduate fellowship at davis. i like apologetics and philosophy too. ask me about that too.


i have ~~no linked-in~~ or twitter. also no website yet. sorry. 

## links

- [github](https://github.com/r-tsang) from berkeley undergrad days
- [github](https://github.com/rchtsang) for davis-related projects, research and coursework. rather empty at the moment (some repos need to stay private atm sorry)
- [github](https://github.com/rctsang) for personal projects (also hosts this repo)
- my linkedin is rather bare at the moment and doesn't really warrant sharing, but [here it is](https://www.linkedin.com/in/r-tsang/) nonetheless

### note

so evidently, i have yet to create a website. in the meantime, all the resume/professional networking-related stuff that i think should eventually belong on the yet-to-exist aforementioned website has been relegated to this git repo. 

this readme has most of what i would put on a website anyways. and i'll add things to this repo when i find time to do that. ~~or when i want to update my resume at 1am like i'm doing right now.~~ somehow i'm managing to update it at a reasonable hour. go figure.
