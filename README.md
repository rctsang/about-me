## bio

hi, i'm ryan. as i use this particular github account for side projects and messing around with stuff, my intro here is somewhat less formal. (if all lowercase didn't already convey that) 


i graduated from uc berkeley with a double major in eecs and engineering physics back in 2019, studying a whole bunch of EE-related things but mostly stuff related to devices and semiconductor physics. i love that stuff. i love physics in general. but in my last semester at cal i took intro to embedded systems and made a hard shift in academic/career trajectory because i liked embedded systems just as much (if not more). so now i find myself in my 5th year as a phd candidate in [prof houman homayoun's research group](https://www.ece.ucdavis.edu/~hhomayou/) and am now working in the area of embedded systems, security, and a bit of engineering education. i've had to play a lot of catch-up with this field, since i lacked exposure to a lot of the related areas and subjects while i was in undergrad (i was studying an almost entirely different area after all), but as hard as it has been, it's been pretty incredible getting to learn all this new stuff. i'm currently working on dynamic analysis for bare-metal firmware and looking at the effects that llm's have on student learning outcomes.


while i'm technically a security researcher, i really love embedded system design and development. i try to tinker and hack around with hardware and software alike when i get the chance, and have a habit of building new tools for myself whenever i can't seem to find the right one. or feel like reinventing the wheel.

i also love teaching. i spent ~2 years on the eecs16a course staff at uc berkeley and loved my experience. i hope one day soon i'll be able to focus on teaching more, but for now i'm still grinding out my research to graduate. i'll enjoy my ta appointments and teaching opportunities wherever i can get them.


as for hobbies, i love reading, especially classic fiction; longboarding, bouldering (primarily indoors), board games, and random other stuff when i have the time. i'm a mentor in the aim christian fellowship at davis where we discuss life's big questions with international and graduate students. i like apologetics and philosophy too, feel free to ask me about it.


i have no twitter. also no website yet. sorry.

- [github](https://github.com/rchtsang) for davis-related projects, research and coursework. rather empty at the moment (some repos need to stay private atm sorry)
- [github](https://github.com/rctsang) for personal projects (also hosts this repo)
- my linkedin is always a tad outdated and doesn't really warrant sharing, but if i know you and you want to connect, [here it is](https://www.linkedin.com/in/r-tsang/) nonetheless
